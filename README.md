# Global Weather Analysis
## Project Idea
As many scientists recognized that due to the angle of the sun beaming at earth, weather conditions are expected to vary with latitudes. Of course, there are other factors contributed to the variation of the global climate, but in this project, the main focus is to "examine" the latitude factor.

## Languages, Tools and Techniques
* Python | Pandas | MatPlotLib | Gmaps | APIs | JSON | NumPy |  SciPy | Math | CityPy
* List Comprehension | DataFrame | Linear Regression   
Note: CityPy is for looking up nearest cities by geo-coordinates

## Process Overview
There are two Python files in this repository: "WeatherPy.ipynb" and "VacationPy.ipynb"

### WeatherPy.ipynb
#### Activities
* Randomly create 500+ coordinates/ cities scattered around the world
* Perform analysis on weather conditions at generated locations
* Build JSON to retrieve data from API host and select relevant data
* Plot weather conditions and find relationship between weather parameters with latitudes
